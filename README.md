# 📝 Task Manager — A MERN Stack To-Do List Application

This project is a simple yet elegant task manager (To-Do List) built using the **MERN stack**, which includes **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React**, and **Node.js**. It allows users to create, update, complete, and delete tasks in a clean and intuitive interface. The project is designed to help you stay organized and productive by keeping track of your daily activities.

## ✨ Features

This project includes the following core features:

- ✅ **Add New Tasks**: Users can type in a task and add it instantly to their to-do list.
- 🗂️ **Display All Tasks**: All current tasks are displayed in a visually appealing card layout.
- ✅ **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Users can toggle a task’s status as complete or incomplete.
- ✏️ **Edit Task Text**: Tasks can be edited inline without needing to remove or re-add them.
- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list permanently.
- 🧩 **Responsive UI**: The layout is optimized for various screen sizes using **Tailwind CSS**.
- ⚡ **Real-time Feel**: The app fetches tasks from the backend on load and updates state after operations.

## 🚧 Features in Progress

- 🔐 **User Authentication**: Feature under development to allow login/logout and user-specific task management.
- 🔄 **Live UI Sync**: Currently, the UI sometimes requires manual refreshing (e.g., after toggling a task). This is being actively worked on to improve reactivity and real-time updates using better state synchronization.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-mern-app.git
cd todo-mern-app
```

---

### Step 2: Setup the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder and add your MongoDB URI and desired port:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

Then run the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your backend API will now be live at: `http://localhost:5000`

---

### Step 3: Setup the Frontend

In a new terminal tab or window:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will launch the frontend at `http://localhost:5173`
